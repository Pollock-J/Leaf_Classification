# There are 3 datasets I am using for classifying leaf images
# Swedish - https://www.cvl.isy.liu.se/en/research/datasets/swedish-leaf/
# Leafsnap - http://leafsnap.com/dataset/
# Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/leaf-classification/data
# In order to keep them the same, I will be segmenting one dataset
# I will be organizing a dataset to be able to better iterate through
# To prep the data to be fed into a CNN I will be squaring the images, then scaling them down
# I will also be augmenting 2 of the dataset that have between 1000-2000 images
